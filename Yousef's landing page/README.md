## Instructions
this is my project which call Landing page
where there are different sections. the web page is responsive and dynamic where I used the vanilia js to achieve the dynamic properties 
like smooth scrolling and navigation bar and activate of classes while scrolling. 
I have created mwthods in js to do the functionalaties and every method is well documented and explained. 
I hope you are enjoying reading my project.
 
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
